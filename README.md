# C-Sharp_Bank

Hello everyone my name is Lucas Henrique.

I bought a C# Course with focus on OOP, and thats the first application I made with what i've learned.
This application have the objective to simulate a Bank, so you should be able to:

1- Create a Checking Account 
2- Create a Savings Account
3- Create an Investment Account
4- Make a Deposit
5- Make a Withdrawal
6- Make a Transfer
7- Check you Account Balance
8- Check you Overdraft
9- Show your Extract
10- Check your Transitions

Some Details that you need to pay attention:

* You cannot create an acount without defining a type
* Each of the Account types have their own Extract 
* You can check on every tansition you make in the account, that includes (Deposit,withdrawal,Tranfer and any transition involving overdraft)
