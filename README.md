# C-Sharp_Bank

Hello everyone my name is Lucas Henrique.

I Bought a C# Couse with focus on OOP, and thats the first application I made with whats i've learned.
This is a Bank fully focuse on OOP and in this application you should be able to:

1- Create a Checking Account 
2- Create a Savings Account
3- Create and ivestment Account
4- Make a Deposit
5- Make a Withdrawal
6- Make a Transfer
7- Check you Account Balance
8- Check you Overdraft
9- Show you Extract
10- Check you Transitions

Some Details that you need to pay attention are:

* You cannot create an acount without defining a type
* Each of the Account typer have their own Extract 
* You can check on every tansition you make in the account , that includes (Deposit,withdrawal,Tranfer and any transition involving overdraft)
